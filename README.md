Assignment by - Sarthak Dang

## Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
We have used Light Gradient Boosting Machine for solving this problem.

## Results
The RMSE value of the model is 68.7627.

## Note
I changed the dataset as 1 row was missing in section number 92. I created a row and added it to the dataset for uniformity.
